The Exhibition History Project was generously funded by the Leon Levy Foundation, which has also committed to underwriting further work on this dataset and the processing of additional records from 1990 to 2000 over the next three years. Not yet included in the dataset are the thousands of film series presented by MoMA’s Department of Film over its 80-year history. Those records will be added in a future phase of the project, as will a history of performance art at MoMA and MoMA PS1 and exhibitions at MoMA PS1.

      This research dataset lists 1,788 exhibitions, representing all of the known exhibitions held at the museum from 1929 through 1989. All known curators and organizers, artists and other participants are listed for each exhibition. A total of 11,550 constituents are represented in this dataset, approximately 5,900 of them not currently represented in MoMA’s permanent collection of artworks.",
